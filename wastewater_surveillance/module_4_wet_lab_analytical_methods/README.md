## üí¨ Discussion Points

- What are your lab's capabilities and challenges?
- What platforms and techniques do you use?
- Why is qPCR still widely used over metagenomics?
- In what cases would metagenomics be preferred?

**Question:** How can we balance feasibility and scientific value in LMIC settings?

**Question:** How do method choices (culture vs molecular) affect target selection?
