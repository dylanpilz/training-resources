    "\n",
    "Tekin works in a national public health lab. His work often involves tracking pathogens and managing data, but he’s tired of copying and pasting values into Excel sheets. One day, he hears about how Python can automate tasks, make data cleaning easier, and even help visualize complex trends from environmental samples. Curious, he decides to start learning Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you’ll follow Tekin as he begins his journey with Python. He’ll learn about variables, basic data types, and how to run simple commands. Each step he takes helps him connect the code to his real-life work — from storing the number of positive cases in a list, to understanding how `print()` can show him outputs immediately.\n",

    "Python is not just for software developers. It's used by public health experts, bioinformaticians, and data scientists around the world. Its clean and readable syntax makes it a perfect choice for someone like Tekin, who wants to spend less time on repetitive tasks and more time on interpreting meaningful trends.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here’s what convinced Tekin to give Python a try:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Easy to Read & Write** → Python’s syntax feels almost like English, which helped Tekin feel more confident as a beginner.\n",
    "- **Versatile** → From automating tasks to analyzing pathogen data, Python is used in many parts of public health work.\n",
    "- **Large Community & Libraries** → Tekin quickly found tutorials, examples, and tools specific to bioinformatics.\n",
    "- **Cross-Platform** → Whether at the office or on his Linux-based laptop at home, Python runs everywhere.\n",
    "- **Fast Prototyping** → He could quickly test out new ideas with just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this course, Tekin aims to build a solid foundation in Python and apply it directly to real-world public health challenges, especially in microbiological surveillance and outbreak analysis.\n",
