    "# For Loops in Python â€“ Tekin Analyzes Wastewater Data\n",
    "\n",
    "A `for` loop allows us to iterate over a sequence (e.g., a string, list, or tuple) and execute a block of code multiple times. This is incredibly useful for analyzing large datasets, which is often the case in wastewater surveillance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use `for` Loops in Wastewater Surveillance?\n",
    "\n",
    "A `for` loop is used to iterate over sequences, such as strings, lists, or tuples, allowing us to process data efficiently without writing repetitive code. In wastewater surveillance, `for` loops are crucial for tasks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Iterating through multiple samples or time points\n",
    "- Checking if viral loads exceed thresholds in a large number of samples\n",
    "- Analyzing sequences of nucleotides or pathogens\n",
    "- Processing large datasets of environmental data, such as reading multiple sequences from a file\n",
    "\n",
    "By automating repetitive tasks, `for` loops help Tekin efficiently analyze wastewater surveillance data. For example, he could loop through a list of samples and apply specific analysis or check each sample's viral load against an established threshold. This greatly reduces the need for manual intervention and helps in processing large batches of data.\n",

    "### But first let's learn what is list!\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a List in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "A list is a built-in data structure in Python that allows you to store multiple values in a single variable. Lists are ordered, meaning the elements inside them maintain their sequence. They are also mutable, which means you can modify, add, or remove elements after creating them. Lists can store different data types, including numbers, strings, or even other lists. In bioinformatics, lists are useful for storing DNA sequences, protein residues, nucleotide frequencies, or gene names. Since lists support indexing and iteration, they allow efficient manipulation of biological data, such as extracting codons, filtering specific nucleotides, or analyzing sequence motifs.\n",
