## Bioinformatics Resources
### NGS Academy for the Africa Pathogen Genomics Initiative
**[SARS-CoV-2 NGS Training Course 2021 For Africa CDC Virtual Workshop](https://uct-cbio.github.io/ngs-academy/2021/NGS-SARS-CoV-2-past-course)**: The NGS Academy forms part of the Africa PGIThis initiative is funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. This training initiatives are carried out in partnership with the African Society for Laboratory Medicine (ASLM)

### CZI/CZBiohub COVID Tracker Resources

**[COVIDTracker Serinar Series](https://covidtracker.czbiohub.org/resources)**: Various discussions and lectures regarding genomic epidemiology theory and interpretation resources from CZI/CZBiohub

 <summary>Notable discussions and seminars
 </summary>
 
- **[Discussion of the overlapping timescales of pathogen evolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt3JNKfU5qk)** and infectious disease transmission, and how to build phylogenetic trees that visualize genetic divergence.
- **[Discussion on measuring divergence over time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAtgJjoy6-w)** in order to estimate the average rate of evolution of a pathogen. We also discussed how to use that rate to make phylogenetic trees with branch lengths in units of calendar time.
- **[Discussion on phylogeography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYpjzP22HcM)**, the technique in genomic epidemiology of inferring spatial migration patterns of a pathogen across the tree. We discussed the inferential procedure that allows this, as well caveats and things to be cautious about.
- **[Seminar on Nextstrain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qllORYfM_z8)**, especially how pipelines are specified in Nextstrain Augur, and different ways to navigate the genomic data visualization in Nextstrain Auspice.
- **[Discussion on consensus genome quality control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeYgWdRbPPo)**, including different quality metrics, the impact of different quality issues on downstream analyses, and how to look at BAM files to assess support for different sites in the consensus genome.
- **[Discussion on data types and data organization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJMTNwDKibI)**. We discussed how using data models helps to organize genomic surveillance metadata and specifically mentioned the PHA4GE data specification for SARS-CoV-2. And then Dan Lu walked us through different genomic data structures, what those different structures are useful for, and which repositories each can be submitted to. She finished the talk off with a discussion of handling GISAID rejections and looking at calls in BAM files.
- **[Seminar on phylogenetic nomenclature systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVorizRS4wk)**--why we use them and types of systems. We finished off with a more detailed discussion of how the Pango nomenclature system for SARS-CoV-2.
- = **[Discussion on the subject of sampling design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycM50nC5wXk)**. While we don't (yet) have formal frameworks for estimating sample size in genomic epidemiology, today we discussed study design, and specifically how to think about sample selection for different types of genomic epidemiological questions/studies.
- **[Seminar on phylodynamic analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8bp0iHCttA)** - a particular area of genomic epidemiology where we infer changes in pathogen population size from the shapes of coalescent phylogenetic trees.
- **[Discussion on antigenic evolution of viruses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFJ_2G4u8w4)** - that is, how viral surface proteins can change how they "look" to our immune systems, and in some cases eventually escape our immunity
