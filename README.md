*Training and Workforce Development Working Group Resources*

Overview
========
This repository hosts [PHA4GE-developed](https://pha4ge.org/) resources that address training standards and assist in developing a workforce to effectively implement pathogen surveillance and epidemiology.

## Contents
- [Rationale](#rationale)
- [Genomic Epidemiology](#genomic-epidemiology)
- [Contributing](#contributing)


Rationale
========
There are several training activities required to upskill a workforce involved in pathogen surveillance and epidemiology. This includes the design of both general and domain specific training on specific topic areas eg. bacterial, fungal, viral pathogens, vectors etc, and identify/tailor courses for different stakeholders.
